# Paediatric COVID-19 Cases in Victoria, Australia

## Overview

For this project, I obtained the daily COVID-19 case numbers for people aged 0-9 and 10-19, and used these to maintain an interactive time-series graph. 

## Tasks

- Used Python in Jupyter Notebooks to download the daily case numbers from the Victorian Department of Health (known as DHHS at the time). 

- Used `mpld3`, a Python package that links Matplotlib to D3.js, to create a time-series graph showing the progression of COVID-19 in the two age groups. 

- This graph was updated daily, and published in `.svg` and `.html` formats, allowing it to be shared or embedded into a web page as either a static image or an interactive visualisation.
